ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
I've added a patch to allow building libpython as a shared library on Irix.
This is not normally supported but the change is minimal so I see no reason
not to do it. It's also much nicer to deal with dependency wise when building
packages.
There is a related patch that adds the correct params to the link stage. It
defaults to -h for setting the soname unfortunately that is not supported with
Irix ld. I changed it to -soname and added -set_version for good measure.
In a similar vein there's some tool param fixes in unixcompiler.py in distutils.
The only patch that was a bit tricky is for ncurses support. Irix 6.2 curses is
not sufficient for the curses module and the checks for ncurses are inadequate.
The problem is that the tests seem to expect that ncurses is the system curses.
I've modified the tests to look for ncurses headers in ncurses/ instead and this
gets the curses module built.
