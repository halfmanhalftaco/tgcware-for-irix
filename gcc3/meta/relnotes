ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------

On Irix 6.2 the build would consistently fail because machname.h was generated
incorrectly by genfixes.
I've provided a patch to fix this. The patch is based on 
http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2004-08/msg02371.html

There where also problems linking with GNU libiconv. This turned out to be
a typo in the aclocal.m4 file. Patch is included.
