ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------

On Irix 6.2 the build would consistently fail because machname.h was generated
incorrectly by genfixes.
I've provided a patch to fix this. The patch is based on 
http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2004-08/msg02371.html

There where also problems linking with GNU libiconv. This turned out to be
a typo in the aclocal.m4 file. Patch is included.

Irix 5.3 specific:
To combat the problems I had with rqs(1) this gcc will *by default* call the
linker with -no_rqs when linking dynamic objects.
If you don't want that then please remove -no_rqs from the gcc specs file.
