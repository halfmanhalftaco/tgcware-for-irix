ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
glib 1.2.10 is broken when building with gcc 3.4.x.
The patch to fix it was taken from the OpenPKG package.

The library was built with pthreads and should be threadsafe.
I had to override the result of the getpwuid_r test since it fails to find
this function otherwise.
