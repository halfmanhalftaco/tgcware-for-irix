ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
glib 1.2.10 is broken when building with gcc 3.4.x.
I added a patch to fix it taken from the OpenPKG package
but ended up building it with MIPSpro so it's not really needed.

The library was built with pthreads and should be threadsafe.
I had to override the result of the getpwuid_r test since it fails to find
this function otherwise.
