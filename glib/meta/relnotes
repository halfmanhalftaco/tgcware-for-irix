ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
glib 1.2.10 is broken when building with gcc 3.4.x.
I added a patch to fix it taken from the OpenPKG package

Added a small patch to glib.m4 to fix quoting.

The rest of the patches was necessary to allow an update of the
libtool stuff. The newer libtool requires autoconf 2.5x so 
configure.in had to be patched up a bit.
Without the libtool update I was not able to include an rpath.
