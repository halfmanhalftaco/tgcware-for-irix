MISCELLANEOUS
-------------
I had to patch groff in 3 places to get it to behave.

Two of the patches are probably only really needed on Irix 5.3
but I couldn't see any problem with applying them on 6.2 & 6.5 too.

While groff itself was built with the gcc compiler above gxditview
was built with MIPSpro 7.3 due to its build system being Imake based.
For building gxditview these options where passed to make:
Irix 6.x:
CC=cc CCOPTIONS="-xansi -n32 -mips3 -woff 1116,1174" LDPOSTLIB=
Irix 5.3:
CC=cc CCOPTIONS="-xansi -32 -mips1" LDPOSTLIB=
