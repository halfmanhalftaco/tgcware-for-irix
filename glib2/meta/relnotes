ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------

On IRIX 6.2 previous tgc_glib2 versions forced the detection of getpwuid_r
and since that needs -lpthread this also required libglib users to link
with -lpthread. That decision has been reversed.
This tgc_glib2 does not use the thread safe getpwuid_r and the pkgconfig file
for libglib nolonger forces linking with -lpthread.
This should make sure that glib using programs that do not make use of the
gthread library can also run on IRIX 6.2 hosts without the pthread patchset.

glib-2.18.2-no-pthread.patch:
We must use -lpthread and not -pthread.

The testsuite has some problems with the gthread tests. Hopefully they are
cornercases and real-life apps won't be affected.
