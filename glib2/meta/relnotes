ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
I forced the detection of getpwuid_r since the configure test fails.
This may be because it needs to link with -lpthread to work and
the test doesn't.
This means that anything using glib2 and not
linking with -lpthread will be subject to this warning that configure
spits out when getpwuid_r is unavailable:
configure: WARNING: the 'g_get_(user_name|real_name|home_dir|tmp_dir)'
                functions will not be MT-safe during their first call because
		there is no working 'getpwuid_r' on your system.
