ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
I forced the detection of getpwuid_r since the configure test fails.
This may be because it needs to link with -lpthread to work and
the test doesn't.
This means that anything linking with glib2 must also link with -lpthread
or risk running into problems with getpwuid_r being unresolved.
I've patched the pkgconfig file to include -lpthread on the link line
for glib2.
