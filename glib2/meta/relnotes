ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------

On IRIX 6.2 previous tgc_glib2 versions forced the detection of getpwuid_r
and since that needs -lpthread this also required libglib users to link
with -lpthread. That decision has been reversed.
This tgc_glib2 does not use the thread safe getpwuid_r and the pkgconfig file
for libglib nolonger forces linking with -lpthread.

CHANGELOG
---------
Fri Nov 14 2008 Tom G. Christensen <irixpkg@jupiterrise.com> - 2.18.2
- Update to 2.18.2
- Don't force detection of getpwuid_r and linking with -lpthread on IRIX 6.2
