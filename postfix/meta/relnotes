ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
This tardist is patterned after the Fedora Core 5 Extras postfix RPM.
The installation will create several groups and a new user for postfix during
the install of the sw.base subsystem.
If inst complains about unknown users and assigning <random number> as uid/gid
then please run postfix set-permissions to fix it
(requires man.doc and man.man subsystems to be installed).
The preinstall.sh script that creates the users is available for perusal under
contrib in the docdir.
Note that these groups/user will not be removed on uninstall.
There is an init script installed. Postfix is disabled by default to enable
it you must also disable sendmail.
Also note that /etc/aliases will only be used by sendmail.
To replace sendmail as the default MTA you can make a backup of
/usr/lib/sendmail and replace it with a symlink to the postfix sendmail
binary.

Irix 6.2 specific:
The patch was inspired by a post by Wietse Venema in reponse to another
users problems with building postfix on Irix 6.5.28.

To disable sendmail use chkconfig -f sendmail off

Irix 5.3 specific:
Unfortunately there is no official way to turn off sendmail.
This is one unofficial way to do it.
To disable sendmail use chkconfig -f mail off
Then add the following line near the top of the /etc/init.d/mail script to
make it honour the chkconfig flag:
if /sbin/chkconfig mail; then :; else exit 0; fi
