ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
Seems the shared library target went away between lua 5.0 and 5.1.
I don't think that's acceptable so this package contains a patch which
builds a shared library.
The lua and luac binaries are still statically linked but since they will be
updated anyway if the package is rebuilt I don't consider it a problem.
I also patched the Makefiles to create an irix specific target with the
proper libraries and options. This also included modifying luaconf.h.
