ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
I had to rename a variable (_pause) since it apparently clashes with something
in libc.
I added a few compat defines for the network stuff (socklen_t & in_addr_t).
Added trio support to cover snprintf/vsnprintf.
Irix 6.2 doesn't have sa_len member in sockaddr struct so I used _MAX_SA_LEN
instead.
