ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
This was a tough one and I spent quite a few hours on it.
A big issue was getopt and inet_ntop. The upstream source contains
an attempt at providing getopt for platforms without a native getopt but
it's broken on Irix 6.2.
Instead of trying to fix that I've added the appropriate gnulib modules
for getopt and inet_ntop support.
The second big issue was that the new non-blocking DNS code did not work.
Something goes wrong in the communication between child and parent I think
but when I found there was a simple blocking fall-back I didn't debug it
further. Instead I have enabled the blocking DNS code fall-back unconditionally
in dnsquery.c (changing __unix__ to __lunix__) and now DNS lookups work.

During install stage one must tell make to use SHELL=bash
since ksh will segfault in gtk/pixmaps/smileys/default.
