ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS

Irix 6.2 specific:
This build is multilib aware and can build binaries for all 3 ABIs
(o32,n32,n64). It should default to n32/mips3.
Note that the o32 and n64 parts are packaged seperately in swo32.base and
sw64.base respectively.

Note that at this time tgcware is strictly n32 due to putting n32 libraries in
/lib which is normally occupied by o32 objects (n32 objects defaults to /lib32).
At some point n64 libraries might appear since they would go in /lib64 which
would not conflict with the standard locations.
There is currently no plan to make a true multilib aware tgcware distribution.

The build was specifically built *without* threads since they are not a
standard feature of Irix 6.2 and would limit the use to only people who are
in possession of the POSIX threads patchset.

Patches:
3 patches are included but they are not necessary for this particular build
configuration.
They do however enable the possibility of building with libgomp and
--enable-threads=posix95.

testresults:
None available for this particular build but full testresults was posted
for a posix95 threads enabled build (including libgomp).
testresults may come at a later date however it takes around 72 hours or more
to run the tests for all 3 ABIs on an Indigo2 R10K/195 and sometimes I just get
tired of listening to the damn thing :)
