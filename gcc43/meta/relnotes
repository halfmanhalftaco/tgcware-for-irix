ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS

Irix 6.2 specific:
This build is multilib aware and can build binaries for all 3 ABIs
(o32,n32,n64). It should default to n32/mips3.
Note that the o32 and n64 parts are packaged seperately in swo32.base and
sw64.base respectively.

Note that at this time tgcware is strictly n32 due to putting n32 libraries in
/lib which is normally occupied by o32 objects (n32 objects defaults to /lib32).
At some point n64 libraries might appear since they would go in /lib64 which
would not conflict with the standard locations.
There is currently no plan to make a true multilib aware tgcware distribution.

Note that this build specifically enables the use of POSIX pthreads. This was
not a standard feature on Irix 6.2 so parts of the compiler may require the
installation of the POSIX pthreads patchset.

If you intend to use this compiler on Irix 6.3, 6.4 or 6.5 I would recommend
that the fixed-includes be regenerated with the included mkheader script.

Patches:
2 patches are included which enables building with libgomp and
--enable-threads=posix95.
Also included is a patch for bz#38400 which fixes all the pthread related
failures in the ada testsuite.
