Irix 6.2 specific:
This build is multilib aware and can build binaries for all 3 ABIs
(o32,n32,n64). It should default to n32/mips3.
Note that the o32 and n64 parts are packaged seperately in swo32.base and
sw64.base respectively.

Note that at this time tgcware is strictly n32 due to putting n32 libraries in
/lib which is normally occupied by o32 objects (n32 objects defaults to /lib32).
At some point n64 libraries might appear since they would go in /lib64 which
would not conflict with the standard locations.
There is currently no plan to make a true multilib aware tgcware distribution.

Note that this build specifically enables the use of POSIX pthreads. This was
not a standard feature on Irix 6.2 so parts of the compiler may require the
installation of the POSIX pthreads patchset.

Patches:
3 patches are included which enables building with libgomp and
--enable-threads=posix95.

testresults:
