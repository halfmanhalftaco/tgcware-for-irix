ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------

You can use chkconfig prngd 'on'/'off' to control automatic startup of this
daemon.
The default setting is 'on' for automatic startup.

Irix 6.2 specific:
You *MUST* install one of the XFS Rollup patches. Minimum patchlevel is
SG0001278 which introduces a fix for a problem with O_RSYNC. The bug means
access to files opened with O_RSYNC would hang after first read.
This trips up prngd which opens its seedfile with O_RSYNC.
The only workaround is to add -n to the start script in /etc/init.d/tgc_prngd
which will cause prngd to not use the seed-file.
