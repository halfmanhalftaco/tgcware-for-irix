ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
There where multiple problems that needed fixing so here's a summary:
arts-1.4.0-sgiaudio.patch: 
- Make configure check for ALopenport instead of alOpenPort
arts-1.4.0-oldaudio.patch:
- Add support for pre Irix 6.5 audio API to the Dmedia audio driver
arts-1.4.0-srandom.patch:
- srandom is in math.h on Irix 6.2
arts-1.4.0-socklen_t.patch:
- Irix 6.2 doesn't have socklen_t and while the configure scripts notices that
  it only defines kde_socklen_t. This patch just adds a socklen_t define.
arts-1.4.0-sched.patch:
- SCHED_FIFO and friends are in sys/sched.h on Irix 6.2 so mcop_mt didn't find
  them.

The changes that are needed to configure really should be done in acinclude.m4
or configure.in.in but I couldn't be bothered to do it.
The check for alOpenPort vs. ALopenport should be enhanced to check for one then
the other.
