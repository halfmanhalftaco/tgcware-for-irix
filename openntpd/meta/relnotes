ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
Configuration files are marked config(noupdate) which means any existing
versions are preserved.

Privilege seperation is enabled and startup will fail until
a suitable user has been created.
This user should be called '_ntp' and belong to its own seperate group.
In /usr/tgcware/share/doc/openntpd-<version>/contrib there is a script called
privsep-user-setup.sh which will attempt to setup such a user.
It requires uid and gid as input ie. ./privsep-user-setup.sh 74 74
to use uid=74 and gid=74.
The '_ntp' user will have its homedir in /var/empty/ntpd.

The daemon is controlled via /etc/init.d/tgc_ntpd and automatic startup
can be configured in the usual way with chkconfig.
