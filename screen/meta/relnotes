ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
The configure.in file is badly written and it unconditionally adds the
sun and crypt libs to the link line.
To fix this I simply ripped out the part of the script that checks those
2 libs.

The right terminfo file should be automatically added to the terminfo
database during installation.
