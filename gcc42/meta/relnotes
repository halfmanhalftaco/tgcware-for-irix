ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------

Irix 6.2 specific:
This build is multilib aware and can build binaries for all 3 ABIs
(o32,n32,n64). It should default to n32/mips3.
Note that the o32 and n62 parts are packaged seperately in swo32.base and
sw64.base respectively.

Note that at this time tgcware is strictly n32 due to putting n32 libraries in
/lib which is normally occupied by o32 objects (n32 objects defaults to /lib32).
At some point n64 libraries might appear since they would go in /lib64 which
would not conflict with the standard locations.
There is currently no plan to make a true multilib aware tgcware distribution.
