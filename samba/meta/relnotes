ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
This package was heavily inspired by the Samba package redhat uses
for Fedora Core 3 which is why the subsystems deviate from my normal
standard.

SWAT is not automatically added to inetd. To do this run the included
startswat.sh script. To remove it again use the removeswat.sh script.

The -irix-ld-argorder patch simply reorders the args for ld when building
shared libraries. Without it the build fails on Irix 5.3.

I had to override samba_stat_hires since the build fails otherwise. It's
most likely a header issue but I was not able to resolve it.

Overriding samba_cv_fpie is perhaps not strictly necessary but since PIE is
not supported anyway even though gcc will accept I thought it more correct
to turn it off.

The -replace-pread_pwrite patch enables use of replacement pread/pwrite
functions in lib/replace.

Irix 6.2 specific notes:
The -ld patch simply hardcodes LD=ld -n32 to force linking n32 objects.

Irix 5.3 specific notes:
I specifically disabled pread/pwrite to make sure the
replacements are used.
Irix 5.3 does have pread/pwrite in libc but they're undocumented and
don't work like expected (they're part of unix98 which Irix 5.3 predates).

The -use-included-fnmatch is needed because Irix 5.3 lacks fnmatch. It's
used only in util/util_tdb.c everywhere else the included ms_fnmatch or 
gen_fnmatch is used. I hope it makes sense to replace fnmatch with gen_fnmatch.
