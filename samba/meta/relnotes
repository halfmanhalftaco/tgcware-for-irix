ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
This package was heavily inspired by the Samba package redhat uses
for Fedora Core 3 which is why the subsystems deviate from my normal
standard.

SWAT is not automatically added to inetd. To do this run the included
startswat.sh script. To remove it again use the removeswat.sh script.

The clitar patch fixes a build issue when building against krb5 1.4. It was
pulled from the samba bugzilla and will be in the next upstream release.
The -ld patch simply hardcodes LD=ld -n32 to force linking n32 objects.
