ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
This package was heavily inspired by the Samba package redhat uses
for Fedora Core 3 which is why the subsystems deviate from my normal
standard.

SWAT is not automatically added to inetd. To do this run the included
startswat.sh script. To remove it again use the removeswat.sh script.

The -header patch works around the fact that the cups headers also
include tcp.h which ends up giving a struct tcphdr redefined error.

Irix 6.2 specific:
The -ld patch simply hardcodes LD=ld -n32 to force linking n32 objects.
