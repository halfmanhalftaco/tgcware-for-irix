ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
I initially wanted to build with gcc so the Irix 6 hints file was hacked to
ignore 64bit mode which it seems to want to default to when using gcc and
os is IRIX64.
Also because I was going to build with gcc 3.4.x the -DIRIX32_SEMUN_BROKEN_BY_GCC
define was removed since that ABI problem was fixed in that release series.
In the end though I chose to use mipspro since it builds faster and perl
is pure C so no C++ abi hoopla to worry about.
To make the build I succeed I had to patch in 3 places where perl
thought it needed to provide prototypes when they weren't necessary.
