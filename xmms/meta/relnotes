ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
There are two working output plugins. The generic esound plugin and
a hacked up version of the sgial 1.0pre plugin that supports the old
dmedia API.
Except for perhaps a tendency to "eat" the last second of a file the
latter plugin works well and uses less CPU time than going through esound.
Also the plugin may have a problem with mono files but it's untested.

Note that the sgial plugin is packaged seperately.
