ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------

libtool likes to use -rpath unfortunately in some cases it misbehaves.
In this case it ends up adding rpaths pointing into the build directories.
This was disabled using:
sed -i 's/hardcode_into_libs=yes/hardcode_into_libs=no/g' configure

Manpages are missing. Though prebuilt ones are in the source 'make install'
refuses to install them.

If the exitops fail to run correctly you'll have to run them by hand:
/usr/tgcware/bin/gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders > /usr/tgcware/etc/gtk-2.0/gdk-pixbuf.loaders
/usr/tgcware/bin/gtk-query-immodules-2.0 > /usr/tgcware/etc/gtk-2.0/gtk.immodules
