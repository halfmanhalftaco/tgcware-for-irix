ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
The patch for Irix support is based on Marcus Herberts changes made
to 3.0.1rc10 in 2002.
The client script is untouched from Marcus Herberts version while the init
script has been updated to better match the style of other tgcware packages.
I've not provided an init script for dhcrelay but a copy of the dhcpd init
script could easily be adapted.

I used site.conf and site.h to customize paths. They're included with the
docs for reference.
