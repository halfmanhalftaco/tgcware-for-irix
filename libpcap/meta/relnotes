ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
On IRIX libpcap tries to get the MTU size via SIOCGIFMTU, unfortunately that
does not seem to be working on my Indigo2 and Indy machines instead it just
fails with EINVAL.
There are two options, either don't try to get the MTU size or assume a
default. I've gone for the first option and libpcap will not try to
assume anything about the MTU. This means that libpcap clients need to tell
libpcap the packet size and make sure it does not exceed the
actual MTU.
The current MTU size can be found from netstat -in.
