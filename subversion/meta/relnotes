ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
I've only packaged up what a make install installs. There are lots
of stuff in the source tree that could possibly be included but sorting
through it all is not at the moment on my list of things todo.

To avoid bogus RPATHs configure was massaged by sed to make sure
hardcode_into_libs=no in the libtool config.
