ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
The configure script is not in good shape at all and required some
heavy handed patching to approach something useable.
Adding trio support was painful and required way too much patching.
All in all this was just way too much work :(

NOTE!
If you previously installed libetpan-0.47-1 then please do this:
upgrade to libetpan-0.47-2
remove tgc_bdb44*
(re)install tgc_bdb43*

The db-4.4.20 (tgc_bdb44) package has been removed as it erroneusly
overwrites part of the files delivered with db-4.3.29 (tgc_bdb43)
which cause trouble.
