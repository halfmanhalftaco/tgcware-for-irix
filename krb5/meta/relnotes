ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
I decided to build without thread support since a number of netdb functions
in Irix 6.2 lacks reentrant versions (_r).

The .k5login man page was renamed to dot.k5login

I've included the latest security patches for 1.4 taken from the FC5
src.rpm. The 1.4 branch is nolonger supported upstream.
