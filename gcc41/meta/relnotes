Irix 6.2 specific:
This build is multilib aware and can build binaries for all 3 ABIs
(o32,n32,n64). It should default to n32/mips3.
To avoid depending on the n64 versions of the system libraries for all of
gcc I've introduced a new subsystem called sw64.lib (for n64 objects).
For now its use is limited to the gcc package as there are several issues
related to packaging that must be dealt with otherwise.

Note that at this time tgcware is strictly n32 due to putting n32 libraries in
/lib which is normally occupied by o32 objects (n32 objects defaults to /lib32).
At some point n64 libraries might appear since they would go in /lib64 which
would not conflict with the standard locations.
There is currently no plan to make a true multilib aware tgcware distribution.
