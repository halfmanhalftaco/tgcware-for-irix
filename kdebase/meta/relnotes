ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
Like with kdelibs there's just a lot of little nits that needs to be fixed
up when building on an old system like Irix 6.2.
The patches are trivial and a few fix what looks like real bugs.
Again like with kdelibs socklen_t is a problem, the 2 different socklen_t
representations are confusing even to the KDE developers themselves.
Also libkdefakes was missing as a dep for snprintf in kdm, it was obviously
never built on a platform with no snprintf.
