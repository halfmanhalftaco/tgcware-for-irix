ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
For some bizarre reason that I'm unable to figure out the gettext in libintl
test fails. Code is exactly the same as in lftp where it works. Go figure.
This means that NLS is currently disabled.

Added support for building with trio for snprint/vsnprint support which the code
depends on.
