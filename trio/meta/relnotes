ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
Added libtool support by creating a makefile.am for use with automake.
Added a needtrio.m4 file for use with aclocal/autoconf.
Patched trio.h header to not attempt to include config.h. It's the wrong
way around and will break the minute CONFIG_H is not config.h
