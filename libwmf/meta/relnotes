ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
Spent half a day beating this mess into submission.
The autotools stuff in the source distribution has been severely
mistreated and as a result it's a real mess to make changes
to.

The io-wmf.so GDK pixbuf plugin was not built since it causes a segfault
in gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders.
