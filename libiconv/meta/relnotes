ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
There's a circular dependency here since gettext in turn
depends on libiconv

Argh! libiconv 1.11 ends up trying to link the newly built iconv command with the already
installed libiconv library in /usr/tgcware/lib. This ofcourse fails :(
To make the final package I first had to do one without the iconv command, install it and
then rebuild and install again allowing the iconv to link correctly.
