ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
lesspipe.sh from Fedora Core 5 was added as a bonus.

The author assumes that CODESET is available if the locale functions
exists sadly that is not the case for Irix 5.3.
Fortunately the code is properly ifdeffed to handle the case of missing
locale functions so to avoid the issue I added a condition on the locale check
in configure in the form of a call to AM_LANGINFO_CODESET which checks for
nl_langinfo and CODESET.

The destdir patch is just a simple fix to the install target in the makefile.
