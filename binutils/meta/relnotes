ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
A number of Windows/Novell only manpages was removed.

The strip program has big problems with stripping libraries.
nm does not seem to work properly on Irix 6.2 and is unable to list any
symbols even when /bin/nm shows they are there.

CHANGELOG
---------
* Thu 18 Sep 2008 <irixpkg@jupiterrise.com> - 2.18-6
- Yet another rearranging of what is put where.
  Since many of the utilities has problems on Irix they
  should not be in the path with the rest of tgcware.
