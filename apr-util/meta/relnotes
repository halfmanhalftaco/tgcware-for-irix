ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
IRIX 6.2 pthreads is a bit peculiar and does not support nested mutexes.
The apr_thread_pool_create function tries to use this type by default
rendering it non-functional on IRIX 6.2.
To avoid this I've replaced APR_THREAD_MUTEX_NESTED with
APR_THREAD_MUTEX_UNNESTED and since the testsuite passes I deem it safe.
The alternative would be to disable thread support entirely in apr.
