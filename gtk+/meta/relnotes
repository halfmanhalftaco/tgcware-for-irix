ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
I added the patches that I considered relevant from the FC5 src.rpm.

The -autoconf25x and -newgt patches was necessary to allow an update
of the libtool code. This update was required on Irix 5.3 otherwise
libtool would refuse to include an RPATH in the finished objects.
