ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
getopt stuff was broken for the case where gnugetopt lib (FreeBSD ports thing) was
not available and the system getopt.h was missing getopt_long.
The getopt_long GNU compat stuff was already included but only activated for WIN32.
I created a patch to activate it even if we're not running on WIN32.
