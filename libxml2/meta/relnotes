ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------

Irix 6.2 specific:
You might need patchSG0002791 or newer with pthread library fixes.
This is due to the way that pthread_equal in earlier POSIX patches
was declared as a macro but in patchSG0002791 and newer it was made a
function instead.
libxml2 assumes it's a function and as such won't build without atleast
patchSG0002791 installed.
