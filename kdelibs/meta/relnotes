ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
Lots of little quirks to handle when building on an old system like
Irix 6.2.
Most of the patches are trivial. Some are the right solutions and some
are just quick and dirty hacks.

The worst problem was the socklen_t crap. There seems to be some 
inconsistency and while the configure scripts know to check for socklen_t
the alternative (kde_socklen_t) is used far from everywhere.
