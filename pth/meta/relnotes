ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
By default pth will detect and use the mcsc/sc/mc combo for the mctx
implementation. This causes all tests to fail when building pth
with gcc while using native SGI cc works. Additionally specifying
--enable-optimize will make all tests fail regardless of compiler.
Choosing the sjlj/ssjlj/sas combo for mtcx instead enabled both gcc
and native SGI cc built libraries to pass all tests both with and
without --enable-optimize.
All tests where done with hard syscall mapping enabled.

WARNING! The pthread compatibility library has some API issues when used
with apr (and likely others aswell).
This means apr cannot use pth pthread compatibility for thread support and
it means that programs using the affected apr API's may run into problems
if they use the pth pthread compatibility layer at the same time.
