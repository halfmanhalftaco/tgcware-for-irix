ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------

There's potential ABI breakage in the C++ part of PCRE.
The pcrecpp::no_arg symbol was moved to pcrecpp::RE::no_arg and the author
is trying to use the linker to create a symbol alias to hide it.
Unfortunately this is not supported on IRIX which breaks the ABI.

CHANGELOG
---------
* Fri Nov 14 2008 Tom G. Christensen <irixpkg@jupiterrise.com> - 7.8-1
- Update to 7.8
- Switch to building with MIPSpro and GNU g++
- Build with --enable-unicode-properties
