ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
Because libpcap cannot determine the MTU on IRIX it is unable to scale back
the default snaplen of 65535 to a size supported by the interface requested.
To make it work by default I've changed the default snaplen to 1514 which is
the max allowed on the ec0 device found in Indy & Indigo2.
