ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
Added a patch from upstream CVS that add additional INET6 guard defines
around in6_addr usage.
Here's the upstream description:
From Markus Schoepflin: don't use "struct in6_addr" if INET6 isn't
defined, because, in that case, "struct in6_addr" probably isn't
defined, either.

Check for too-large bit lengths in TLVs.
