ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
Irix 6.2 only has OpenGL 1.0 (+ enough extensions to mostly cover OpenGL 1.1)
but is lacking a few functions that freeglut needed.
The patch comments these function calls and while the demos are still working
it's a hack and some functionality is likely broken by it.
