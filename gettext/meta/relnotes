ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
I chose not to follow the authors packaging proposal.
Mostly because I found it to not translate that well to the way
Irix packages are built and also because of the fact that
the proposed Runtime package actually contains some headerfiles etc. which
to me didn't make much sense.
Instead I'm using the standard layout so with base you'll get everything
except docs and development libraries.
